      I left my job at world's no.1 company: Google Dropped offers by world's
      no.1 e-comm platform: Amazon Declined job at world's best bank: J.P.
      Morgan And accepted to work at world's happiest company: Adobe My choices
      in life are always questioned by people. But it's not about the
      destination, it's the journey... The people I met... The knowledge I
      gained... and the life experiences I shared with them.

      Just imagine the fun. And I was just a regular kid in class! If that
      ignites the spark in you, brace yourself and love the journey! P.s. I know
      the show-off in initial lines... But achieve kia hai toh thoda show-off
      toh banta haiðŸ˜œðŸ™ˆ
