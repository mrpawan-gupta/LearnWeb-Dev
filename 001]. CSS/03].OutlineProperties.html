    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
      CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript.

    <p>
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
      including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
      accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
      of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share
      formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which
      reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as
      enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
      the pages that share the file and its formatting.
