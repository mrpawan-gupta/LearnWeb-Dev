      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
      CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
      content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve
      content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
      specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages
      to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file
      which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well
      as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
      between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
