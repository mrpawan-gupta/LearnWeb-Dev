        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
        including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
        accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
        of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share
        formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which
        reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as
        enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed
        between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
