      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
      CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript

    <p style="color: black; background-color: bisque">
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
      including layout, colors, and fonts.<span style="background-color: blue">
        separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility
        and control in the specification of characteristics, enable multiple web
        pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate
        .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
        content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the
        page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
        formatting</span
